I am building a full-stack web project called **Smart Student Management System (SSMS)**.

Here is the project scope and stack:

🛠 Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React/TypeScript generated via V0.dev)
- **Backend**: Java using Servlets & JSP (MVC architecture)
- **Database**: MySQL using JDBC (or Hibernate - optional)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

🔐 Authentication:
- Admin Login
- Student Login & Register (session-based)

📂 Admin Panel Features:
- Add/Edit/Delete/View Students
- Search and filter student data
- Upload student profile pictures (optional)
- Mark Attendance
- Post announcements/notifications

👨‍🎓 Student Panel Features:
- Register/Login
- View academic profile (grades, attendance)
- Download assignments or upload homework
- View notifications

🎯 Additional Notes:
- Project follows MVC pattern
- Database tables: `users`, `students`, `attendance`, `assignments`, `notifications`
- Frontend UI can be auto-generated using V0.dev and integrated into JSP pages
- All pages should be connected via form `action` or JavaScript `fetch()` to corresponding Servlets
- Use `web.xml` to map servlet routes
- Host it on GitHub and optionally deploy

Now, based on this project description, generate clean and functional code or help me create modules/components/logic as needed.
